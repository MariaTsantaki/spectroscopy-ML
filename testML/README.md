# spectroscopy-ML
Machine learning for spectroscopy

**Disclaimer:** This is a work in progress




## Usage

```python

python spectroscopy_ml.py
```

You need the heavy zipped hdf files from my dropbox. The spec_ML_marcs is the grid for the training, the spec_ML_marcs_validation are synthetic random spectra as a validation sample and the spec_ML_sn4 are real spectra as a test sample.
